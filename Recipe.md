three forth to 1 teaspoon garam masala
1 teaspoon coriander powder(optional)
12-14 cashews

MAKING PANEER BUTTER MASALA :-

1.Heat a pan on a low flame with 1 and half tbsp butter.When the butter melts, add all of the following spices
    2 green cardamoms
    1 bay leaf
    half inch Cinnamon
    3 cloves

2.When the spices begin to sizzle, add 1 and half teaspoon ginger garlic paste.Saute for about 1 min or when you get a good aroma :) . Take care to cook this on low to medium heat. Do not burn the paste.

3.Next pour in onion tomato puree. Also add about one forth teaspoon of red chilli powder (gives a bit of spice and a deeper colour). Ensure the stove flame is low otherwise the curry begins to splatter.

4.Immediately pour half cup water and mix it well and bring it to a gravy consistency. If it is too thick you can add little more water.

5.Cover and ccook on a medium flame until the gravy turns thick & flavorful.

6.When the paneer butter masala gravy is ready, you will see traces of fats over the gravy. You will get a golden brown colour.Open the lid and cook until the gravy turns thicker.Taste test and add more salt if needed.

7.Make sure the gravy reaches the desired consistency then add 200-250 grams paneer. Take 1 teaspoon kasuri methi in your palm and crush ir between both your palms and add it to the butter masala.
*Avoid adding paneer when the gravy is still runny.*

8.Stir well on a low flame cook covered just for 1 to 3 minutes.Cooking for lomger can make the paneer harder.Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of cream and stir. You should get a thick creamy texture.
